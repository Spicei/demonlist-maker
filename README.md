# demonlist-maker

Orders all of your completed demons by difficulty so you can have your own demonlist thats why I called it that

# How

Uses patented CCGameManager.dat save file reader technology to gather your save data

Decrypts your save file using Absolute's save file decrypter code which i stole (https://pastebin.com/JakxXUVG)

Sends guys into file to get demons and then gets difficulty from GDDL spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xaMERl70vzr8q9MqElr4YethnV15EOe8oL1UV9LLljc/edit#gid=1413530556)

Sorts and sends to file
